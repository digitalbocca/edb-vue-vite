# Roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines the development roadmap for the edb-vue-vite project. It includes short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals, as well as guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Current Status

The project is a Vue 3 and Vite based template with a solid foundation, including:

- Pre-configured tools for development, testing, and linting.
- A base component library.
- State management with Pinia.
- Routing with Vue Router.

## Short-Term Goals

- **Increase Test Coverage:** Write additional unit and integration tests for critical components and business logic to ensure code quality and stability.
- **Improve Inline Code Documentation:** Enhance code comments and documentation within the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.

## Mid-Term Goals

- **Expand Base Component Library:** Develop more reusable base components to promote consistency and reduce code duplication across the application.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Audit and Improvements:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit based on WCAG guidelines and implement necessary improvements to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Performance Analysis and Optimization:** Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations for bundle size, rendering speed, and API response times.

## Long-Term Goals

- **Internationalization (i18n):** Implement internationalization support to allow the application to be easily translated into multiple languages.
- **State Management Review and Optimization:** Conduct a comprehensive review of Pinia stores and their usage to identify opportunities for optimization, simplification, or refactoring.

## Contribution Guidelines
