# Roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines the development roadmap for the edb-vue-vite project. It includes short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals, as well as guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Current Status

The project is a Vue 3 and Vite based template with a modern and comprehensive foundation, including:

- **Pre-configured modern tools:** Vite with Rolldown bundler, Vitest, ESLint, Husky, and z-vue-scan for development debugging
- **Extensive component ecosystem:** Base component library + Vue Bits integration via JSRepo for premium components
- **Advanced animations:** Motion-v integration, rotating text, auto-animate, and confetti effects
- **State management:** Pinia v3.0.3 with reactive stores
- **Routing:** Vue Router v4.5.1 with modern setup
- **Testing infrastructure:** Complete Vitest setup with coverage reports and UI
- **Performance optimization:** Rolldown bundler for 10x faster builds

## Recently Implemented âœ…

- **Vue Bits Integration:** JSRepo configuration for premium component library access
- **Advanced Animations:** Motion-v library with RotatingText component implementation
- **Development Tools:** z-vue-scan for component re-render visualization
- **Modern Dependencies:** Updated to latest versions (Vue 3.5.21, Pinia 3.0.3, etc.)
- **Enhanced Component Library:** Multiple base components with comprehensive testing
- **ApexCharts Integration:** Interactive charts with vue3-apexcharts v1.8.0

## Short-Term Goals

- **Complete Code Documentation:** Expand JSDoc documentation coverage across all components and utilities to improve code maintainability and developer experience.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Implementation:** Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support to existing components, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
- **Component Testing Expansion:** Write comprehensive tests for all base components (badges, input, stats) and Vue Bits integrated components.

## Mid-Term Goals

- **Performance Analysis and Monitoring:** Implement performance monitoring tools, conduct bundle analysis, and optimize Core Web Vitals despite already having Rolldown optimization.
- **Dark Mode Implementation:** Add comprehensive dark mode support across all components and animations with smooth transitions.
- **Enhanced Vue Bits Integration:** Create custom Vue Bits component templates and establish a curated component library for the organization.
- **Advanced Animation Patterns:** Develop reusable animation patterns and transitions using motion-v for consistent UX across the application.

## Long-Term Goals

- **Internationalization (i18n):** Implement Vue I18n for multi-language support with dynamic language switching and locale-based formatting.
- **Advanced State Management Patterns:** Explore and implement advanced Pinia patterns like state persistence, cross-tab synchronization, and optimistic updates.
- **Micro-Frontend Architecture:** Investigate module federation possibilities for scalable application architecture.
- **AI-Powered Development Tools:** Integrate AI-assisted code generation tools and smart component suggestions for enhanced developer productivity.
